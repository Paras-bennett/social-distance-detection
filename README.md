# social-distance-detection
In the time of Covid-19, Social-distancing is an effective way to slow down the transmission of
infectious virus. People are advised to minimize their contact with each other to minimize the risk of
the disease being transmitted through direct contact. Maintaining a safe distance is a challenge for
many places like factories, banks, buses or railway stations and airport etc.
So as there were many corona safety projects like Automatic hand sanitizer and contactless
temperature sensor machine, here we are going to build a Social Distancing Detector system using
OpenCV and yolo.
â€¢ The objective behind this project is to develop a social distancing detector that will detect
whether the people is maintaining the physical distance or not.
